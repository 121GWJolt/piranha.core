# Welcome to Piranha.Core

This is a **complete rewrite** of Piranha CMS for the new Core CLR, ASP.NET 6 & Entity Framework 7. The goal is to create a platform independent version, but still provide tight integration with the services available in **Windows Azure** such as `Blob Storage` & `Media Services`.

Piranha.Core is currently built for `1.0.0-rc1-update1` and uses the following packages:

* AutoMapper `4.2.1`
* EntityFramework.MicrosoftSqlServer `7.0.0-rc1-final`
* EntityFramework.Commands `7.0.0-rc1-final`
* Microsoft.AspNet.Mvc `6.0.0-rc1-final`
* Microsoft.Extensions.PlatformAbstractions `1.0.0-rc1-final`
* Newtonsoft.Json `8.0.2`
