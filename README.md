# Welcome to Piranha.Core

This is a **complete rewrite** of Piranha CMS for `NetStandard` & `.NET 4.61`. The goal of this
rewrite is to create a version capable of targeting multiple platforms & frameworks with minimal
depenencies, but still provide a flexible & high performance CMS library.

At the moment Piranha is compiled for `NetStandard 1.6.1` & `.NET 4.6.1` and uses the following packages:

* AutoMapper `5.2.0`
* Dapper `1.50.2`
* Markdown `2.2.1`
* Newtonsoft.Json `9.0.1`

## Licensing
Piranha CMS is released under the **MIT** license. It is a permissive free software license,
meaning that it permits reuse within proprietary software provided all copies of the licensed
